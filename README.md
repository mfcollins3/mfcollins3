# About Me

Welcome! My name is Michael Collins. I am a Technical Client Director at
[Neudesic](https://www.neudesic.com) and am based in Tempe, Arizona. I have
been a professional software developer since July 1994. I'm very passionnate
about technology and learning. I love programming in different programming
languages and learning how to use them and what they are capable for. I really
enjoy building mobile applications for my iPhone and iPad.

I live in Surprise, Arizona, with my wife and three children. I do a lot of
hobby programming outside of work. I love reading, especially non-fiction
books or fantasy fiction. I love to cook and bake, especially anything with
chocolate.
